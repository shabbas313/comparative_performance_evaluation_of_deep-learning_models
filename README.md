# Comparative performance evaluation of deep-learning models reveals precision and efficacy in variants classification

This repository contains code and data related to the study on the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into genomics for the classification of genetic variations.

## Overview
The integration of AI into genomics has ushered in a new era, significantly enhancing our ability to identify genetic variations in the human genome. Deep-learning based models play a significant role in advancing our understanding of the complex landscape of genomic data and providing insights into the genetic causes of diseases. This study focuses on evaluating the performance of three deep-learning based models - ESM1b, AlphaMissense, and EVE - in predicting the effect of mutations using three independent datasets compiled from ClinVar, ICGC, and variants classified as Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS) from the TP53 database.
